•	The name of the constructor is same as its class name. 
•	Constructors are mostly declared in the public section of the class though it can be declared in the private section of the class. 
•	Constructors do not return values; hence they do not have a return type. 
•	 A constructor gets called automatically when we create the object of the class. 
•	Constructors are used when variables need to be initiated before object is called.
•	Constructors can be overloaded. 
•	Constructor cannot be declared virtual.

•	The prototype of Constructors is as follows:
	<class-name> (list-of-parameters);
•	Constructors can be defined inside or outside the class declaration:-
•	The syntax for defining the constructor within the class:
	<class-name> (list-of-parameters) { // constructor definition }
•	The syntax for defining the constructor outside the class:
<class-name>: :<class-name> (list-of-parameters){ // constructor definition}

## TYPES OF CONSTRUCTORS:

### 1. Default Constructor: Default constructor is the constructor which doesn’t take any argument. It has no parameters. It is also called a zero-argument constructor.

### 2. Parametrized Constructor: To create a parameterized constructor, simply add parameters to it the way you would to any other function. When you define the constructor’s body, use the parameters to initialize the object.

### 3. Copy Constructor: A copy constructor is a member function that initializes an object using another object of the same class. In simple terms, a constructor which creates an object by initializing it with an object of the same class, which has been created previously is known as a copy constructor.

## Destructors:

•	A destructor is also a special member function like a constructor. Destructor destroys the class objects created by the constructor. 
•	Destructor has the same name as their class name preceded by a tilde (~) symbol.
•	It is not possible to define more than one destructor. 
•	The destructor is only one way to destroy the object created by the constructor. Hence destructor can-not be overloaded.
•	Destructor neither requires any argument nor returns any value.
•	It is automatically called when an object goes out of scope. 
•	Destructor release memory space occupied by the objects created by the constructor.
•	In destructor, objects are destroyed in the reverse of an object creation.
